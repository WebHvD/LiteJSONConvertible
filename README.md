#LiteJSONConvertible

A minimalistic approach to JSON parsing

# Features
- Gereric protocol with associated type
- Generic functions

# Notes
This is just a small experiment on JSON parsing using generic protocols. The basic ideas behind this approach are from the following articles:
- [Parsing JSON in Swift](http://chris.eidhof.nl/posts/json-parsing-in-swift.html)
- [Efficient JSON in Swift with Functional Concepts and Generics](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/efficient-json-in-swift-with-functional-concepts-and-generics)
